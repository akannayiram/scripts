Windows Batch Scripting:
 - Use "echo [%date% %time%] - Error message" to write timestamp to logfile
 - Use SETLOCAL DELAYEDEXPANSION to dynamically set MSG within an IF bloc and then
       output using "echo !MSG! >> %LOGFILE%". Notice the use of exclamation (!) instead of %
       Excalmation delays the expansion (Normally expansion happens at the beginning of mulit-line IF, FOR statements.
       To take advantage of dynamically setting a variable as a result of a condition, we have to delay the expansion.
